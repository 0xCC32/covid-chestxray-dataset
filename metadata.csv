The brightness of both lungs was decreased and multiple patchy shadows were observed; edges were blurred, and large ground-glass opacity and condensation shadows were mainly on the lower right lobe. Tracheal intubation could be seen in the trachea. Heart shadow roughly presents in the normal range. On the left side, the diaphragmatic surface is not clearly displayed. The right side of the diaphragmatic surface was light and smooth and rib phrenic angle was less sharp. Chest x-ray on Jan 10 showed worse status (2B)"
