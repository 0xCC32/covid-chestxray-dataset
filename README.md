# COVID-19 image data collection

We are building a database of COVID-19 cases with chest X-ray or CT images. We are looking for COVID-19 cases as well as [MERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome), [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome), and [ARDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome). 

All images and data will be released publicly in this GitHub repo. You can contribute with pull requests. For chest X-ray dcm, jpg, or png are preferred. For CT nifti (in gzip format) is preferred but also dcms. Please contact with any questions.

Currently we are building the database with images from publications as they are images that are already available.

Our goal is to use these images to develop AI based approaches to predict and understand the infection. Our group will work to release these models using the open source [Chester AI Radiology Assistant platform](https://mlmed.org/tools/xray/).
